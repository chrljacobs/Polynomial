# Polynomial
Fast Polynomial Evaluation.
This program allows users to create polynomials, then multiply, add, and subtract them to form new polynomials, then evaluate them with three different methods and time it. It uses a brute force evaluation method, Horn's method, and exponentiation by squaring method. 
It was created as a project for an Algorithm Analysis class. 
I have included a few test .txt files for use in the program. You can use these or make your own.
Polynomials must be less than 100 terms (though this is easily changed in the code.)
